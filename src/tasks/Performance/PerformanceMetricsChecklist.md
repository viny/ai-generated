# Performance Metrics Checklist for Dashboard Component

## Metrics to Measure Before and After Implementation

### Core Web Vitals
- [ ] Total Blocking Time (TBT) - Primary metric to improve
- [ ] First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- [ ] Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- [ ] Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- [ ] Interaction to Next Paint (INP)

### Additional Performance Metrics
- [ ] Time to Interactive (TTI)
- [ ] First Input Delay (FID)
- [ ] JavaScript execution time
- [ ] Memory usage

## How to Measure

### Using Chrome DevTools
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)
2. Go to the Performance tab
3. Click the record button and reload the page
4. Interact with the Dashboard component
5. Stop recording and analyze the results
6. Look for "Total Blocking Time" in the summary section

### Using Lighthouse
1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Go to the Lighthouse tab
3. Select "Performance" category
4. Click "Generate report"
5. Review the metrics, focusing on Total Blocking Time

### Using Performance API
You can also add instrumentation code to measure specific operations:

```javascript
// At the start of your component or operation
const startTime = performance.now();

// After the operation completes
const endTime = performance.now();
console.log(`Operation took ${endTime - startTime} ms`);
```

## Expected Improvements
- Total Blocking Time should decrease significantly
- UI should remain responsive during computation
- No freezing or jank when the component mounts
- Smoother user experience overall

## Additional Considerations
- [ ] Test on different devices (mobile, desktop)
- [ ] Test with different CPU throttling settings
- [ ] Measure impact on battery usage (for mobile devices)
- [ ] Verify that the computation result is the same as before
